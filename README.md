## Usage

## Features
*Add new transactions by filling out the form at the top of the page and clicking the "Add Transaction" button.
*Search for existing transactions by typing in the search bar.
*Sort transactions by clicking on the column header.
*Delete transactions by clicking the "Delete" button next to the transaction.

## Technologies Used
This application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It also uses useState hook to handle the state of the transactions and search term, and useEffect hook to fetch data from a local database file.

## Future Improvements
Here are some potential improvements that could be made to this application:
Implement a login system to allow multiple users to manage their own transactions.
Add the ability to edit transactions.
Use a database instead of a local JSON file for storing transactions.
